Longer answer: The alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum:   Phoenician â‡’ Greek â‡’ Latin â‡’ modern languages with letters like J, W, and ÃŸ, as well as diacriticals like Ã¥ and diphthongs like Å“.   As a result, thereâ€™s no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. The alphabet for English is different from that of French, or Swedish, or Polish. Consider the Hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:  a, Ã¡, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, Ã©, f, g, gy, h, i, Ã­, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, Ã³, Ã¶, Å‘, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, Ãº, Ã¼, Ã», v, w, x, y, z, zs  Now, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the Latin alphabet remains. The additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. As with English, we have the Latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. The insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify.   But for the Latin order, itâ€™s trickier. Latin is a blend of Etruscan and Greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. For example, Etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a â€˜kâ€™ sounds today: C, Q, and K (probably â€˜kayâ€™, â€˜qooâ€™ and â€˜kaâ€™ but this is a guess since Etruscan remains untranslated). G was a lesser-used sound in Etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented C from G, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the â€˜otherâ€™ k sound further down the line from Ï˜ or qoppa , a pre-standardized Greek letter used in some cities.   Long story short, thereâ€™s some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters.   So for example, the Beth Gimel Dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into Greek as Beta Gamma Delta, but then the Gamma was replaced with C in Latin.   EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!',\n 'rejected': \"Hindi alphabets are ordered in two different categories: all vowels preceeds the order followed by all the consonants. The ordering is very clever and when you speak in the order, you can notice the subtle movements of the tongue and muscles in a particular way.   For example, the first four consonants are 'Ka', 'Kha', 'Ga', 'Gha'. When you pronounce it you see your tongue rises with every alphabet.  See this chart for all the consonants in order.  Edit: A word.\"}"
